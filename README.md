# Enigma in Racket

This is my implementation of a simple three-rotor Enigma, sans plugboard or ring settings.

This is a solution to an assigment I created for my students at Dev Bootcamp. They are required to implement this simple Enigma simulator in Racket, using only the List data structure. They're also encouraged to favor recursion over any loop constructs.

 * `enigma.rkt` — contains the simulator itself, with a few simple tests
 * `collection.rkt` — a few helper methods for interacting with lists
 * `rotors.rkt` — rotor related functions (rotation, reflect, signal translation)
 * `string.rkt` — string related functions
