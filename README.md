# Enigma in Racket

This is a solution to an assigment I created for my students at Dev Bootcamp. 

Students are required to implement a simple three-rotor Enigma in Racket, sans plugboard. They are asked to implement their simulator without loop constructs like `for`, and using only the List data structure (for example, no `structs`.)

 * `enigma.rkt` — contains the simulator itself, with a few simple tests
 * `collection.rkt` — a few helper methods for interacting with lists
 * `rotors.rkt` — rotor related functions (rotation, reflect, signal translation)
 * `string.rkt` — string related functions
